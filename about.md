My professional passion is all things related to DevOps.  I started as a developer many years ago for a company with no operational staff.  The developers were responsible for all the servers.  Over time I found that as much as I enjoy coding, I enjoy managing servers even more.  After a while I found myself in what is now referred to as DevOps.

I enjoy thinking of infrastructure as code.  The ability to programmatically managed infrastructure in a cloud environment to easily create or scale something new is fascinating to me.  Gone are the days of having to wait weeks or months for new hardware to meet new demand.  There are certainly applications for baremetal servers.  I just don't work in an environment like that.

My O/S of choice is linux.  Which distro I prefer over the years has changed.  Currently I prefer CentOS 7.

My configuration management software of choice is Chef.  The testability of a cookbook gives me a large degree of confidence whenever I release a new version that it won't break something unintentionally.  The environment that the chef community has created is one I want to be a part of.  Almost all my open source experience has been with the Chef community.  It has been nothing but positive.

Why Talking to the Duck?  I talk to myself when working.  I talk to myself _a lot_ when working.  Talking things out to yourself isn't [all that uncommon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).  I found this helps me work through a problem to arrive at a solution that I will regret later.  Recently I've started to occasionally stream while coding.  That has also been quite beneficial for me, and I hope my audience.  I came to realize that there are lots of little decisions or things I do which other people don't know about.  The purpose of this blog is to explain those things to a broader audience.  It's also so I can make sure things make sense... by Talking to the Duck.
